start
create a new object of BTree
when user inputs the number
add it to the btree, if root does not exist yet
    create the node object and draw it
    if root already exists recursive add node 

On recursive add node
traverse throught the node 
if the data is less than the parent traverse left else right 



Objects 

BTree: represents the whole binary tree 
- property context, Line, root=null;

Line:
- represents the line between two node
- has function draw which draws the line between two nodes

Node:
- represents the node in the tree
- has property leftNode=null and rightNode=null
